READ ME for Programmers: Word Guess Game
This code implements a simple single-player word guessing game in JavaScript.

# Functionality:

Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters or the entire word.
They have three chances to guess correctly.
The game provides feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
Code Breakdown:

# WordGuessGame class: This class manages the game state, including the player name, hidden word, and remaining tries.

1. TakeTurn method: This method handles each player's guess, checking for matches and updating the game state.
Game Loop: The game continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of tries.
Winning and Losing Conditions: The player wins by guessing the full word correctly. The player loses after using up all three tries.

## Next Steps:

* Consider integrating this with a user interface (HTML/CSS/JS) for a more interactive experience.
* Explore options for expanding the game with features like word banks, difficulty levels, or multiplayer functionality.
* Interface Design Questions:
# What visual elements would enhance the user experience?
How can we incorporate feedback messages effectively?
How can we use design to guide user interaction?
* Interface Checklist:
* Branding: Logo and subtitle ("Guess a letter or the whole word").
* Welcome Screen: Title ("Welcome to the Word Guess Game").
* Player Information: Input field for player name, displaying the name in the title after submission. (e.g., "Welcome to the Word Guess Game, John!")
* Guess Input: Field for players to enter their guess (letter or full word).
* Feedback Messages: Display messages for correct guesses, incorrect guesses, winning, and losing.
* Visual Cues: Consider progress bars or visual representations of the hidden word with blank spaces and revealed letters.
